# BurgerLogger

This application allows the user to enter what kind of burger they would like to eat.  Once the burger order is placed the burger then is made and you have the option to devour the burger.  Once the burger is devoured it is then placed on the devour side.  When the user refreshes the page the orders and burgers devoured persist.  This applicated is built with mysql, node, express, handlebars and ORM.  It uses the MVC design pattern.
